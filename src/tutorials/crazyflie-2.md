{% si_intro Unpacking the Crazyflie %}
The Crazyflie 2.0 packet contains the following items. Make sure that you
have all of them before you start assembling.
{% endsi_intro %}

{% si_step package contents %}
* 1 x Crazyflie 2.0 control board with all components mounted
* 5 x CW propellers
* 5 x CCW propellers
* 6 x Motor mounts
* 1 x LiPo battery (240mAh)
* 5 x Coreless DC motors
* 2 x Short expansion connector pins (1×10, 2mm spacing, 8 mm long)
* 2 x Long expansion connector pins (1×10, 2mm spacing, 14 mm long)
* 1 x Battery holder expansion board
{% endsi_step %}



{% si_intro Testing; test %}
The Crazyflie 2.0 is tested extensively in the production, but to make sure
nothing has happened during shipping/storage you should run the tests before
starting the assembly. Power on the Crazyflie 2.0 using a USB source (either
computer or charger) and check the results of the test below. Note that it’s
important to hold the Crazyflie 2.0 steady during the test and away from strong
magnetic sources.
{% endsi_intro %}

{% si_step self-test %}
Before you start assembling anything, run the power on self-test by
connecting the Crazyflie 2.0 to a uUSB power source. The LEDs M1 and M4
will indicate the result of the test. If the M4 LED blinks GREEN five times
fast, then the test has passed.

{% tutorialVideo \videos\self_test_pass.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step self-test fails %}
If the self-test fails, then the M1 LED blinks 5 times fast RED, then pauses
and does it again. Go to our [support forum](//forum.bitcraze.io) to get help.

{% tutorialVideo \videos\self_test_fails.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}



{% si_intro Assembling; assembling %}
Assembling your Crazyflie 2.0 will probably take less than 10 minutes, but
there are a few pitfalls. So make sure to follow the instructions below!
{% endsi_intro %}

{% si_step twisting the wires %}
Start by twisting the wires of the four motors. This will reduce electronic
noise and make the wires fit better in the motor mount “hooks”.

{% tutorialVideo \videos\twisting_the_wires.mp4 %}

{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step mount the motors %}
Push the four motors into the motor mounts. You will need some force to
insert them. If it is difficult doing it as in the video try putting the
motor can towards a table edge and press on the mount, however don’t press
on the motor axis while inserting them as it might damage the motor. The
motor should be inserted all the way to the stop in the mount.

{% tutorialVideo \videos\mount_the_motors.mp4 %}

{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step attach the twisted wire %}
Attach the twisted wire into the two small “hooks” that are underneath the
motor mount.

{% tutorialVideo \videos\attach_the_twisted wire.mp4 %}

{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step insert the motor %}
Insert the motor mounts on the Crazyflie 2.0 wings. They are press fit and
might need a small amount of force. Make sure they go all the way to the
stop. It’s not important which motor you put where. After it’s been
inserted, connect the motor connectors to the Crazyflie 2.0.
{% tutorialVideo \videos\insert_the_motor.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step attach the propellers %}
Now it’s time to attach the propellers. Note: There are two kinds of
propellers, the clock wise (CW) and counter clock wise (CCW) propellers,
each kind has their own bag in the box. Here we are attaching the CW propellers.

{% tutorialVideo \videos\attach_the_propellers.mp4 %}

Here’s a detailed view of where to attach CW and CCW propellers.
{% img Crazyflie 2.0 propeller mounting; medium; /images/getting-started/cf2_props.png %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step attach the rubber pad %}
The rubber pad should be attached to the Crazyflie 2.0 between the
expansion headers. This will create friction, keep the battery from
slipping out and also protect the electronics.
{% tutorialVideo \videos\attach_the_rubber_pad.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step attach headers %}
There are two types of headers in the box, long and short ones. Find the
two short ones and insert them into the expansion connector.
{% tutorialVideo \videos\attach_headers.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step attach the battery %}
Place the battery between the headers inserted into the expansion connector
and insert the battery holder board onto the headers. Watch out for the
pins that can be a bit sharp when inserting it. The friction should hold
the battery in place so tighten it until it does.

Now connect the battery
and you are finished with the assembly. The battery wires can preferably be
bent and placed underneath the PCB to be out of the way.
{% tutorialVideo \videos\attach_the_battery.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step power on! %}
The assembly is finished, now it’s time to power it on! Note that the power
button is a push button, not a sliding button. During the power-on
self-test all the propellers will spin in sequence. Make sure they all
spin, if they don’t then check the motor connections.
{% tutorialVideo \videos\power_on.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step getting to know your Crazyflie; leds %}
First of all, lets look at what is front and back, this is important when flying
and also when mounting expansion decks. The small "bump" (the antenna) is on the front
and the blue LEDs are at the back.
{% img Crazyflie board from the top; medium; /images/getting-started/frontCF.png %}

#### Start up sequence

When the Crazyflie 2.0 is powered on it will automatically go through a short
sequence of events to get ready for flight.

1. **Run self tests** - the Crazyflie 2.0 checks that the hardware is OK
1. **Calibrate sensors** - the Crazyflie 2.0 reads its sensors to get base values.
It must be *absolutely still* to do this, so it's best to put it on a level surface for a second.
1. **Ready to fly!**

#### Understanding LEDs

You also need to understand what the LEDs mean.

* **Power on and all is good:** The blue LEDs (2 and 3) are fully lit and the
front right LED (1) is blinking red twice every second.
* **Power on and all is good but sensors are not yet calibrated:** The blue LEDs
(2 and 3) are fully lit and the front right LED (1) is blinking red with 2 seconds interval.
Put the Crazyflie 2.0 on a level surface and keep it absolutely still to calibrate.
* **Radio connected:** The front left LED (4) is flickering in read and/or green.
* **Battery low:** The front right LED (1) is fully lit in red. It's time to
land and re-charge the battery.
* **Charging:** The back left blue LED (3) is blinking while the right back blue LED (4) is lit.
* **Boot loader mode:** The blue LEDs (2 and 3) at the back are blinking
approximately once every second.
* **Self test fail:** The right front LED (1) is repeatedly blinking five short
red pulses with a longer pause between groups.
{% endsi_step %}

{% endsi_step %}




{% si_intro Installing on a computer; inst-comp %}
When using a computer to fly the Crazyflie, you also need a standard
gamepad ([more information](//wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:crazyflie:pc_utils:inputdevices))
for maneuvering and a Crazyradio PA for communication.
{% endsi_intro %}

{% si_step installation flavour %}
There are a few options of how to run the PC client

{% tabgroup %}
{% tab VM %}
We have created a virtual machine (VM) to help you get into the air as quickly as possible.
The VM has all software you need for flight and development pre-installed. Since 
it runs on a virtual machine it should work the same way on most operating systems 
and this is also why our documentation is based on the virtual machine. 
{% endtab %}
{% tab Windows %}
There is an installer for native installation on Windows. This option will install
the latest version as a binary and is a great option for flying, but will not add
support for development.

Read more in the [install on Windows](#inst-win) section.
{% endtab %}
{% tab Linux %}
On Linux it is possible to run the client from source code. With this option you 
are required to clone the source code from git and install a few software packages. 
If you are interested in this solution, read more about how to set it up on 
[github](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python/blob/master/README.md).


When you have set up the client, insert the Crazyradio PA and your gamepad in 
your USB-ports and start the client. Continue reading about how to [configure the client](#config-client) 
{% endtab %}
{% tab OS X %}
On OS X it is possible to run the client from source code. With this option you 
are required to clone the source code from git and install a few software packages. 
If you are interested in this solution, read more about how to set it up on 
[github](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python/blob/master/README.md).

* Click the “Connect” button.

Now that you have connected your Crazyflie to your client, telemetry data
is continuously sent from the copter to the client. When you move the
Crazyflie around you will see the flight data being updated in realtime, as
well as battery status and the link quality.
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_intro Flying; flying %}
Now it's time to do some flying, but first there are some basics you need to know about.
{% endsi_intro %}

{% si_step orientation; orientation %}
First of all, it is much easier to fly when the copter is pointing away from you.
The blue LEDs are on the back, so keep them pointing in your direction when
starting to fly.
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step maneuvering a quadcopter; maneuvering %}
When flying a quadcopter there are four main dimensions of controls; roll, pitch, yaw and thrust.
{% img Axis; wide; /images/getting-started/AxisImage.png %}

* **Roll -** is the rotation around a horizontal axis going through the quadcopter
from back to front. This literally rolls the Crazyflie and moves it left or right.
* **Pitch -** is the rotation around a horizontal axis going through the quadcopter
from left to right. This tilts the Crazyflie and moves it forwards or backwards.
* **Yaw -** is the rotation around a vertical axis. This rotates the quadcopter
left or right. Yaw is used when changing flying direction by pointing the front
of the Crazyflie in different directions.
* **Thrust -** adjusts the altitude, or height, of the Crazyflie.
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step the mobile app / game controller %}
The controls on the gamepad or mobile app have the following mapping:
{% img Control mapping; medium; /images/getting-started/controller.png %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step normal flight %}
When thrusting without touching any other controls, this is what it might
look like. The Crazyflie usually drifts in some direction if not
compensated for, this is completely normal.
{% tutorialVideo \videos\normal_flight.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step the ground effect; ground-effect %}
When the copter is flying close to the ground (less than a few decimeters
above the ground) it is affected by what is called the ground effect. The
feeling is that the air is slippery, almost as if it is gliding on ice.
To avoid this, particularly when learning to fly, use a lot of thrust just
when taking off and then ease off for level flight.
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step if the Crazyflie is unbalanced; unbalanced %}
If your Crazyflie drifts a lot when taking off, there are a few things you should check.

* Make sure the battery is centered. If it has slipped
too far to either side, the Crazyflie might have a hard time
compensating for it.
* Check that the propellers are spinning freely. Blow lightly on them, one by one,
and verify that they turn. A common problem is that hair is jammed between the
propeller and motor. If this is the problem. just pull the propeller off from the
motor, remove the hair and reinstall the propeller.
* Check that the propellers are balanced, [see the balancing propellers guide](/balancing-propellers/)
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step charging the battery; charging %}
To charge the battery of the Crazyflie 2.0, just plug in a micro USB cable. Make
sure the Crazyflie is powered on. While the battery is charging, the back left
blue LED will blink. When the LED is fully lit the battery is charged.
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step go fly! %}
Have fun!
{% endsi_step %}
